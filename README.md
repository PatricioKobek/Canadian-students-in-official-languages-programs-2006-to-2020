Canadian students in official languages programs (Nationwide, Provincewide, Alberta decrease)

Through Canada, educational departments or ministries organize, delivery, and assess education at the elementary and secondary levels. As can be seen in the corresponding charts in the XLSX file in this repository, there are significant differences in the quantity of students engaged in second-langauge acquisition at the elementary or secondary level. In addition, the provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and the terrotories have no data to report.

The first chart illustrates the overall quantity of students throughout Canada from 2006 to 2020. Although there have been ups and downs, the overall trend has been increasing and projected to continue.

The second chart takes a closer look at each individual province. While most provinces appear to have steady or increasing quantities over the same fifteen-year period, Alberta appears to be in decline.

The third chart delves into this and shows the quantity of students in Alberta from 2006 to 2020. Surprisingly, it is the only province to being showing a steady decrease in enrollment. This is an area for future investigation, as most other provinces have remained relatively steady in their quantities of students or have increased during this fifteen year period.
