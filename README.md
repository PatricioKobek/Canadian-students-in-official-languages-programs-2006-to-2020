Canadian students in official languages programs (Nationwide, Provincewide, Alberta decrease)

Through Canada, educational departments or ministries organize, delivery, and assess education at the elementary and secondary levels. As can be seen in the corresponding charts in the XLSX file in this repository, there are significant differences in the quantity of students engaged in second-langauge acquisition at the elementary or secondary level. In addition, the provinces of Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and the terrotories have no data to report.

The third chart details the quantity of students in Alberta from 2006 to 2020. Surprisingly, it is the only province to being showing a steady decrease in enrollment. This is an area for future investigation, as most other provinces have remained relatively steady in their quantities of students or have increased during this fifteen year period.
